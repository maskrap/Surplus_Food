## Objectives

* As a user, I want to be able to create my personal account.

* As a user, I want to be able to list foods and categorize them alphabetically, location, serving size, and entity.
* As a user, I want to be able to see foods listed by category (dairy, meat, veggie, fruit, etc).
* As a user, I want to be able to see what kind of entity is listing the food (individual, restaurant, brewery, grocery, farm, food business, non-profit etc)
* As a user, I want to be able to see all of the foods available on the exchange.
* As a user, I want food names and locations to be saved with a capital letter no matter how I enter them.
* As a user, I do not want foods to be saved if I enter a blank name.
* As a user, I want to be able to share listings via social media. 
* As a user, I want to be able to send messages to food listers to set up a pick up location and time.
